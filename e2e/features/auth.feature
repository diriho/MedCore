Feature: Authentication
  Doctors, patients, and admins sign in with a user ID and PIN.

  Scenario: Doctor signs in with valid credentials
    Given I am on the home page
    When I fill "user id" with "DOC-001"
    And I fill "pin" with "4242"
    And I click the "sign in" button
    Then the URL should contain "/dashboard"

  Scenario: Login fails with the wrong PIN
    Given I am on the home page
    When I fill "user id" with "DOC-001"
    And I fill "pin" with "0000"
    And I click the "sign in" button
    Then I should see "invalid"
